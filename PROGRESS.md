## In Progress

### Battlefield UI Polish
- ✅ Enlarged battlefield semicircle footprint (BattlefieldArena offset + BattlefieldRings padding) so the arc ends just above the Combat Lane.
- ✅ Adjusted stack expansion layout (16px gap) so mini enemy cards sit above their group card instead of overlapping it.
- ✅ Repositioned the encyclopedia/info card to the right of the group card, aligned just below the mini cards, and removed the hover delay so it appears alongside the mini row.
- ✅ **Weapon animation timing sync**: Gun aim → muzzle flash → bullet fires → bullet hits enemy → damage visuals. Previously damage appeared before bullet arrived.
- ✅ **Real-time mini-panel HP**: Individual mini-panel HP bars now update immediately when an enemy in an expanded stack takes damage.
- ✅ **Unit death display**: Enemy HP clamped to 0 (no negative HP). Mini-panels animate death (flash red, scale, fade) and remaining panels reposition.
- ✅ **Encyclopedia card cleanup**: Info cards now properly hide when stacks are removed or hover state is lost. Previously they could stay up indefinitely.
- ✅ **Lane-based group positioning**: Replaced dynamic angular distribution with fixed 12-lane system. Lane 0 = far left, Lane 11 = far right. New groups randomly assigned to available lanes.
- ✅ **Ring movement lane preservation**: Groups keep their lane index when moving Far→Mid→Close→Melee. Lane occupancy tracked per ring.
- ✅ **Non-overlap enforcement**: 12px collision buffer between panels, size clamping (min 0.7x) when >6 groups per ring.
- ✅ **Z-order by ring**: Melee renders above Close above Mid above Far (z_index 4, 3, 2, 1).
- ✅ **Lane placement tests**: Automated test scene `TestLanePlacement.tscn` verifies no-overlap, lane preservation, 12-lane filling, and z-ordering.

### Code Refactoring (Best Practices)
Extracted UI panel builders, helpers, and scene components to keep files under 500 lines:

| File | Before | After | Change | Status |
|------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Shop.gd | 1628 | 1081 | -547 | ✅ Complete |
| CombatScreen.gd | 1664 | 1300 | -364 | ✅ Complete |
| BattlefieldArena.gd | 5171 | 4096 | -1075 (-21%) | 🔶 Partial - needs architecture change |

**New Helper Files Created:**
- `scripts/ui/shop/ShopPanelBuilder.gd` - Shop panel creation (~420 lines)
- `scripts/ui/shop/ShopStatsFormatter.gd` - Stats/tag formatting (~75 lines)
- `scripts/ui/combat/CombatOverlayBuilder.gd` - Combat overlay creation (~296 lines)
- `scripts/ui/combat/GlossaryData.gd` - Glossary entries data (~110 lines)
- `scripts/combat/BattlefieldEffects.gd` - Visual effects helpers (~312 lines)
- `scripts/combat/BattlefieldInfoCards.gd` - Enemy info card/tooltip creation (~320 lines)
- `scripts/combat/BattlefieldStackManager.gd` - Stack/group management (~480 lines)
- `scripts/combat/BattlefieldRingManager.gd` - Ring drawing/barriers (~260 lines)
- `scripts/combat/BattlefieldDangerSystem.gd` - Danger highlighting (~180 lines)
- `scripts/combat/BattlefieldTargetingHints.gd` - Card targeting hints (~170 lines)

**New Reusable UI Scenes Created:**
- `scenes/combat/components/DamageNumber.tscn` + `.gd` - Floating damage/hex/heal numbers
- `scenes/combat/components/MiniEnemyPanel.tscn` + `.gd` - Mini panels in expanded stacks
- `scenes/combat/components/EnemyStackPanel.tscn` + `.gd` - Stack panel with count, HP, intent
- `scenes/combat/components/IndividualEnemyPanel.tscn` + `.gd` - Individual enemy panel

**BattlefieldArena Refactoring Status:**
- ✅ Created 6 manager classes (Stack, Ring, Danger, Targeting, Effects, Banners)
- ✅ Extracted 4 UI components to scene composition
- ✅ Reduced file from 5171 → 4096 lines (21% reduction)
- ✅ All visual components now use dedicated scenes for easier editing
- 🔶 Still 4096 lines - reaching 500 lines would require splitting into multiple Node scenes

**Why 500 lines isn't achievable with current architecture:**
BattlefieldArena manages complex shared state (enemy_visuals, stack_visuals, position tweens, etc.) that all systems need access to. The helper classes reduce code duplication but the orchestration logic must remain in the main file. To reach ~500 lines would require:
1. Converting managers from RefCounted to Node children
2. Making enemy_visuals/stack_visuals into signals or shared state managers
3. Splitting BattlefieldArena.tscn into multiple sub-scenes with their own scripts
This is a significant architectural overhaul beyond simple refactoring.

**Future Refactoring (Optional):**
- [ ] CardEffectResolver.gd - 1019 lines, consider splitting by effect type
- [ ] CombatManager.gd - 1180 lines, consider extracting phase handlers
- [ ] BattlefieldArena.gd - Continue migration to managers for full <500 line target

### Phase 11: Balance & Testing
- [ ] Test weapon duration system (turns, kills, burn_out)
- [ ] Test deployed weapon tracking (cards out of deck while deployed)
- [ ] Test weapon expiry behavior (discard, banish, destroy)
- [ ] Test warden starter bundles
- [ ] Test explosive damage and splash mechanics
- [ ] Test beam chaining with hex spread
- [ ] Test piercing overflow mechanics
- [x] Regression: MiniEnemyPanel autoload + setup coverage (`scenes/tests/TestMiniEnemyPanel.tscn`)
- [ ] Test shock slow application
- [ ] Test corrosive armor shred
- [ ] Test all 32 new artifact triggers
- [ ] Verify Overclock fires all deployed guns
- [ ] Verify Tag Infusion adds tags to guns
- [ ] Test cross-tag synergies (beam+hex, explosive+barrier, etc.)
- [x] Verify Battlefield enemy center position damage numbers (TestEnemyCenterPosition)
- [x] Regression: Battlefield stack hover + layout (TestBattlefieldUI)
- [x] Regression: Threat rings use EnemyInstance attack predictions (BattlefieldArena/TestRunner)
